# **Story**

One day, Imām Abū Dāwūd (God the Exalted have mercy on him!) was traveling to a distant land. He was going to journey by ship, and he had boarded it. The ship was leaving shore when he faintly, but clearly, heard someone sneeze on land and follow it up by saying, "All praise and gratitude belongs to God." [*Alḥamdu lillāh* (1)]

He sprang into action, immediately calling for a smaller boat to take him back to shore for just a minute. Back on land, he found the man who had just sneezed and told him, "God have mercy on you!" [*yar ḥamukallāh* (2)]

The sneezer replied, "God guide you, and set aright your affairs!" [*yahdī kumullāhu wa yuṣliḥu bālakum* (3)] 

The Imām returned satisfied to his ship and paid the rower one silver coin [*dirham*] for the short ferry. The curious passengers asked Abū Dāwūd what he had just been doing. He explained that perhaps the man who had sneezed was someone whose prayers [*duʿā*] are easily accepted;  to get his prayers the Imām went back to shore and replied to his sneeze. 

Everyone was amused by the trouble he took for such a small affair. As the ship began its journey, they quickly forgot about the incident and returned to their own business. But that night, all of them heard a voice during their sleep:

**"O people of the ship! Abū Dāwūd has purchased Paradise from God — for one silver coin!"**

# **Reflection**

*This is a short story, but what it contains is life-changing. Give it a thorough read and reflect on it yourself before hearing someone else's thoughts.*

## *Internal Resolve*

The Imām's ship was leaving shore when he heard someone sneeze and praise God — but he still knew that *would* reply to him. This is a marvelous alertness, and an eagerness to do whatever good that is made possible for him.

He had a destination to reach, and he was obviously someone renowned for his great service to Islām — did he really need to take all that trouble to do such a little thing? Rather, God blessed him to do big things because he was righteous in small matters; truly the big is made up of the small.

Moreover, his natural resolve to do good was grounded in a deep point of understanding: that we are all in utter need of God the Greatest to accept a single action of ours. *Who are we to think any good deed we have ever done has been accepted by God, His Glory be glorified?* 

Are they not full of errors, known and unknown? Are our intentions not diverted, if ever featuring Him at all? Is not our attention always unfocused, whether in worship or not? Do we not give precedence regarding our time, attention and care to everything and everyone else over Him?

And even if we did something "right", He may still reject our deeds and remain completely just — for He has created us, grown us and protected us till date; He has provided us the time, materials and ability to do the good action, and then He allowed us to do it. The action belongs to Him and so He can reject it freely and be fair, and we would not even know until it's too late.

Furthermore, we may carry out one tiny evil that we deem insignificant — but that could be what leads us to the Fire![^1] These realities must produce a fear in us that propels us towards good and away from bad. (And truly, leaving evil is a good deed itself.)

On the other hand, we do not know what He *does* accept from our meager deeds. It could be the smile you held with family even though you felt terrible, that time when you cleared a single piece of litter from the street, or just that one class during which you remembered God. 

We can hope, knowing that *His Mercy prevails over His Wrath,*[^2] that He is looking for anything we do by which He may have some kind of excuse to forgive us. Our fear from earlier is thus balanced.[^3]

If He does accept anything of our deeds, that one acceptance would be enough.[^4] This is because acceptance means one is among the God-fearing [*muttaqūn*] — and truly their destination cannot be but Paradise. This was the understanding of one of the Companions[^5]:

> One day, a beggar came to him [Ibn ʿUmar — God be pleased with him!] and he told his son to give him a gold coin [*dīnār*]. Afterwards, the son said, "May God accept it from you, O beloved father." 

> Ibn ʿUmar said, "If I knew that God had accepted from me just one prostration, or a charity of a single silver coin [*dirham*] — it would be more beloved to me than anything. For do you know from whom He accepts? 

> **'Indeed, God but accepts [the offering] of the God-fearing.’"** [Qur'an 5:27]

It is from this understanding that Imām Abū Dāwūd must have strived to perform even that tiny deed: because it could be his one action that is accepted. 

The sneezer's prayer for him may have been accepted, or perhaps maybe the angel's reciprocal prayer for him from when he prayed for the sneezer,[^6] or maybe God Almighty accepted his utterly sincere and needy attitude.

## *Knowledge*

The end of the story relates that the Imam had earned Paradise — and he was able to do so through the knowledge he had been blessed with.

Clearly he knew the prayer we are advised to say to the believer who sneezes and the consequent reply by the sneezer[^7]; without it this story wouldn't have happened. But he also knew his neediness as a slave of God and all that has been mentioned above, which drove him to act.

Knowledge is key. We are in a time when people are unaware of even the basic essentials of faith: what is forbidden and what is compulsory. At the same time, someone who knows what is right but does not act upon it brings about his own doom as well. Knowledge and action must go hand-in-hand.[^8] This story demonstrates the fruits reaped by a man of knowledge.

> "The fruit of knowledge is in acting upon it."[^9]

## *Outward Confidence*

Even if we knew what to do and the thought crossed our minds, we would be too meek to carry it out. This saying has sadly come to be true:

> "I fear the day when the disbelievers are proud of their falsehood, and the Muslims are shy of their faith."\
> —ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb[^10]

On a ship with so many other people watching, truly our thoughts would be: 

*If I leave the ship now, everyone else will think I'm weird… they might make fun of me. I might even trouble them by delaying them! Why should I spend a whole silver coin for such a short boat ride? I don't have to reply to the person who sneezed anyway, it's optional… And maybe I just imagined it! Let's me stay here…*

But Imām Abū Dāwūd was not lazy or meek — he knew what would be more pleasing to God and so he would do it. If any concerns came to him he dealt with them as they actually were, instead of letting (or making) them grow and become flimsy excuses to delude himself with.

The truth of his situation:

- To keep his ship waiting was fine; society didn't run by the minute in his era, so taking maybe 10 minutes to go and come back would not be an annoyance to the crew or passengers.

- Any amount of money spent getting to shore would count as charity spent for the sake of God. *And it ended up being counted as his admission to Paradise!*

- People would wonder what in the world he's doing; but when he's back on board and they're asking him what he just did, that would actually be a golden chance to preach his faith!

-  If people still thought he was crazy or weird, it would be God's blessing that he could follow the tradition of His past messengers and be considered mad.

On top of internal resolve based on key knowledge, Abū Dāwūd possessed the confidence and perspective that let him carry out what he thought internally he should do. 

And he thought only about what would be most pleasing to God.
